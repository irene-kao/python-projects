<p> This is a collection a python projects I've completed while self-learning python. Most of the projects are from the Udemy course <a href=https://www.udemy.com/course-dashboard-redirect/?course_id=2776760>100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp.</a> The course helped me gain a solid understanding of python in a fun and practical way.
